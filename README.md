## Welcome to David McCann's SNHU Capstone Project 

This ePortfolio is a final capstone project for Southern New Hampshire University's Bachelor's of Computer Science curriculum. In this ePortfolio, the goal was to take previous artifacts and enhance them to showcase growth and knowledge in Software Design and Engineering, Algorithms and Data Structures, and Databases. Code review videos recorded before enhancements were made detail the artifacts and the enhancements that took place throughout the capstone project. Links are provided below to the code reviews as well as the completed enhancements. Additional images and code samples detailing the project can be found on GitHub as well.

### Self Assessment

Throughout my two years at Penn State Abington, two years at Rochester Institute of Technology, and a year and a half at Southern New Hampshire University, I have always worked towards becoming a programmer because I felt my skills were best utilized designing and coding software. For my first years in college at Penn State and RIT, I went to school for Game Design and Development, and I was able to face and overcome many challenges designing and programming video games. With the last year and a half at SNHU working towards a Bachelor of Computer Science, I further tested my ability as a programmer, always overcoming the challenges the courses and I set for myself. 

The capstone project detailed in this ePortfolio I feel best exemplifies my skills that make me the kind of programmer that will make me an asset for any company. With the capstone project, we were tasked to enhance artifacts we have previously worked on. I chose personal projects I have worked on outside of school to be the focus of these enhancements. These projects originally showcased my ability to plan and execute on a vision, from the design phase to the implementation of the project. The enhancements I have made during the course of the capstone project further showcase these skills, as I was able to identify ways to improve the projects and fully incorporate every one of those improvements in a timely manner. 

Each enhancement was done over the course of a week. With each enhancement, I took what I learned throughout my college career and furthered that knowledge. One of my strongest attributes is that I love to push my limits and learn new things, so I relish the opportunity to tackle any new challenges or obstacles that I face. This can be shown in my enhancements, as in my “Who’s that Pokemon” project, for example, I took what I learned about MongoDB from school and furthered my knowledge so that I could learn how to utilize Mongo DB in Python. Likewise, in my “Game Collection” project, I was able to research how to use the MongoDB driver for C# and update my previous code utilizing the driver to enhance my project without losing any functionality of my previous work. 

It is a programmer’s responsibility to write the code for a project so that its vision can be fulfilled, and the enhancements showcased in this ePortfolio show my ability to do as such. With each challenge I face, I continue to push forward and improve. This ePortfolio showcases my skills as a programmer, showing that I have the ability to take project requirements and break down those requirements into working software. The code provided in these enhancements I hope show my programming skills as well, as I take pride in trying to follow object oriented designs, as well as providing clean, organized, and commented code. I have learned a lot throughout my time pursuing a Computer Science degree, and I plan on continuing to work hard and push forward so that I can utilize my skills while also continuing to learn and improve.
