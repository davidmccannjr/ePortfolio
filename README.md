## Welcome to David McCann's GitHub ePortfolio

This ePortfolio was a final capstone project for Southern New Hampshire University's Bachelor's of Computer Science curriculum. In this ePortfolio, I will take two previous artifacts and enhance them to showcase my growth and knowledge of Software Design and Engineering, Algorithms and Data Structures, and Databases.
